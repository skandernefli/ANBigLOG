                  Entilators will be taken from certain New York hospitals and
                  redistributed to the worst-hit parts of the state under an
                  order to be signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo.

                  New York saw its highest single-day increase in deaths, up by
                  562 to 2,935 - nearly half of all virus-related US deaths
                  recorded yesterday. The White House may advise those in virus
                  hotspots to wear face coverings in public to help stem the
                  spread.
                </p>
                <p>The US now has 245,658 Covid-19 cases.</p>
                <p>
                  A shortage of several hundred ventilators in New York City,
                  the epicentre of the outbreak in the US, prompted Mr Cuomo to
                  say that he will order the machines be taken from various
                  parts of the state and give them to harder-hit areas.

                  Amid a deepening crisis, top health official
                  <span class="user">Dr Anthony Fauci</span> has said he
                  believes all states should issue stay-at-home orders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I don’t understand why that’s not happening,” Dr Fauci told
                  CNN on Thursday. “If you look at what’s going on in this
                  country, I just don’t understand why we’re not doing that.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “You’ve got to put your foot on the accelerator to bring that
                  number down,” he added, referring to infection and death
                  rates.

                <p>
                  The comments from Dr Fauci, who heads the National Institute
                  of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared to contradict
                  those of President Trump, who has consistently dismissed the
                  notion of a nationwide lockdown.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “It’s awfully tough to say, ‘close it down.’ We have to have a
                  little bit of flexibility,” Mr Trump said on Wednesday.

                  Covid-19 is carried in airborne droplets from people coughing
                  or sneezing, but there is some dispute over how far people
                  should distance themselves from each other, and whether masks
                  are useful when used by the public.

                        The WHO advises that ordinary face masks are only
                        effective if combined with careful hand-washing and
                        social-distancing, and so far it does not recommend them
                        generally for healthy people.

                        However, more and more health experts now say there are
                        benefits. They argue that the public use of masks can
                        primarily help by preventing asymptomatic patients -
                        people who have been infected with Covid-19 but are not
                        aware, and not displaying any symptoms - from
                        unknowingly spreading the virus to others.

                  Masks may also help lower the risk of individuals catching the
                  virus through the droplets from another person’s sneeze or a
                  cough - and people can be taught how put masks on and take
                  them off correctly, they argue.

                  the pandemic, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has warned
                  that New York risks running out of ventilators for patients in
                  six days.
